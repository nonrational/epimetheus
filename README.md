# Ἐπιμηθεύς

> But when the gods completed this deception of sheer doom, against which there is no remedy,
> Father Zeus sent the famed monster-killer (Hermes) to Epimetheus,
> the swift messenger of the gods, bringing the gift. Nor did Epimetheus
> take notice how Prometheus had told him never to accept a gift
> from Zeus the Olympian, but to send it
> right back, lest an evil thing happen to mortals.
> But [Epimetheus] accepted it, and only then did he take note in his mind that he had an evil thing on his hands.
>   ~ Hesiod, Works and Days
